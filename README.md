How It Works:

Str8EdgePoser is an interactive chat game where players are annoymously polled based on something stigmatized. 
Those who have never engaged in said stigmatized activity are said to be the Str8EdgePoser. Then the count of
total Str8EdgePosers are revealed, but the screen names remain annoymous. If the count of Str8EdgePosers exceed 
the number of confessors who have done that stigmatized activty, the priorties are inverted 
into seeking those who have engaged in the stigmatized activity. However, if the confessions are unanimous 
then they are polled with a new question. 


[Soft Version]
Also users have the option to privatley opt out of polls they don't feel comfortable with.
Whether the confessions are unanimous or if someone annoymously opts out, the users won't have a way of knowing since they will be polled again.


...

Before each round for that particular question starts, users are asked to come up with their annoymous screen name.
some strategies based on going by unusual personalities or deceptive text styles may be considered to vote off the mole on each round.

Let's consider a situation with 6 players

Confession: "I have never gotten drunk"

Now let's say only 1 player answered no. The count of Str8EdgePosers will be revealed, and the result will reveal:
"1" Str8EdgePoser has answered "No", find them

Players will also have the option to create private groupchats within the chatroom for their own strategic purposes. [Screenshot alert enable?]

The rounds will be 8 minutes each to vote off the Str8EdgePoser. Players will be publically asked if they want to continue playing.

If the Str8EdgePoser is still in the game it wins.
